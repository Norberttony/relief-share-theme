# Relief Share Theme
This is the WordPress theme for [Relief Share](http://relief-shareinternational.org). It empowers FSE (full-site editing) using WordPress' new template-based editor, but it can be used with the Gutenberg editor as well. The code still needs some tidying up (such as changing plugin-specific styles to be more general, or moving them to a child theme).
